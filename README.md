--Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning--

Project Overview :
    This project is a machine learning model trained to classify iris flowers into three species:

    1.Setosa
    2.Versicolor
    3.Virginica

The classification is based on four features :

    *Sepal length
    *Sepal width
    *Petal length
    *Petal width


Project Structure :

    #Data Loading: Iris dataset is loaded from an external CSV file. [url = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv]
    #Data Visualization: Visual exploration using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand feature distributions and relationships.
    #Model Selection: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained.
    #Model Evaluation: Performance is assessed using accuracy score and a classification report.

Technologies Used : 

    #Python
    #Pandas
    #NumPy
    #Scikit-Learn
    #Seaborn
    #Matplotlib
