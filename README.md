# ML-Project-1

Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model trained to classify iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

The classification is based on four features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset widely used for testing and benchmarking classification algorithms.

Project Structure
Data Loading: Iris dataset is loaded from an external CSV file.

Data Visualization: Visual exploration using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Model Selection: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained.

Model Evaluation: Performance is assessed using accuracy score and a classification report.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Seaborn

Matplotlib
